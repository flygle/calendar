We need to discuss this with kde-core team and find a way to have GNOME and other desktops use the calendar without a full dependancy on kdelibs. 

Some options are

1) Move calendar to a separate library
2) Integrate it with any libraries that every one depends like glibc
3) Keep a local copy of date directory - not a good idea
